But there are also universal methods that even a beginner can master. How you wrap boxing bandages is a matter of choice and practice. But first, itâ€™s worth mastering one of the most popular methods.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The loop is placed on the thumb;</li>
                    <li>a bandage is taken away from it along the back of the hand and wrapped around the wrist 2-3 times;</li>
                    <li>after this, make a loop around the index finger and draw a loop around the palm;</li>
                    <li>then make a loop around the middle finger and again around the palm;</li>
                    <li>in this way, they go around each knuckle, return to the thumb, and the end of the bandage is fixed with Velcro on the palm.</li>

                    <h3>How to Throw Boxing Punches:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Jab</b> - throw your front hand in a straight line towards your opponent.</li>
                        <li><b>Right Cross</b> - throw your back arm straight towards your opponent, rotate your back leg and twist your entire body into the punch to hit harder.</li>
                        <li><b>Left Hook</b> - rotate your entire body, including your legs, straighten your left arm a little and then throw your fist out from the side in front of you, as if you were trying to punch your opponent from the side</li>
                        <li><b>Left Uppercut</b> - rotate your entire body again, but now bring your left fist down before throwing it up, rotating your body.</li>
                        <li><b>Right Uppercut</b> - rotate your entire body the same way you would throw a right cross, but then lower your right arm a little before throwing it up.</li>

                    <h3>Some Tips for Hitting:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Straight punches and hooks are usually thrown with the fist rotated so that your palm faces the floor when you punch. When you throw uppercuts, turn your fist so that it faces palm up.</li>
                        <li>You can hit one at a time, but it's usually better to hit 3 or 4 at a time. No more than that.</li>
                        <li>Boxers usually aim their punches at the head, chest, stomach, ribs, or anywhere else in the body.</i>
                        <li>Traditionally, boxers throw straight punches from long range and use hooks and uppercuts only at short range. You must breathe with each punch to conserve energy and maximize the power of your punches.</li>

            <h3>Stance.</h3>
            <p>Stand with your dominant arm and leg behind you. Feet are shoulder-width apart, toes pointing diagonally at an angle of 45 degrees. Your gloves are usually held near your cheeks, with your elbows pointing down. The knees are slightly bent and the back is straight. The shoulders are turned slightly to the side, so your upper body is not facing your opponent.</p>

            <h3>Move Like a Boxer.</h3>
            <p>You can move around the ring any way you want. Try to keep your feet close to the ground and move them or not lift them too high off the floor when moving. You need to try not to cross your legs, get them too close or too far apart because you can easily lose your balance and you won't be in position to strike. Regardless of how you decide to move, try to return to your stance before striking. Just remember that jumping around the ring will waste a lot of energy.</p>

            <h3>Counter-Strikes.</h3>
            <p>It is a combination of defense and attack. Beginners who are just learning boxing will usually switch between striking and defending. A more experienced boxer knows how to defend himself and hit when his opponent attacks. Once you learn a few basic counters, you will learn how to block your opponent's punches while attacking him from the side where his punching hand left a hole. Examples of counter-punching are punching over, under, or around your opponent's punches while he's throwing punches at you. You can also get ahead of sweeping blows by throwing a straight punch right in the center.</p>
